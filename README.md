# Anti-AdBlock

The above HTML code creates a simple message with a heading, paragraph, and a button. The CSS code adds some styling to the message and button. The JavaScript code checks if an ad blocker is enabled by creating a test ad element and checking its height. If the height is 0, then an ad blocker is enabled. If an ad blocker is enabled, the anti-adblock message is displayed, and the disable ad block button is created. When the button is clicked, the page is reloaded, allowing ads to be displayed.

Note that this is a very basic example and may not work in all situations. It's also important to note that some users may choose to leave a website rather than disable their ad blocker, so it's important to weigh the pros and cons of implementing an anti-adblock solution.
